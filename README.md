# DevOpsify – Web Application

This is a simple Golang-based web application developed **as the base app for a DevOps demonstration project**.

It is designed to support the implementation of DevOps practices such as:

- **Containerization** with Docker  
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)** using pipelines  
- **Deployment and orchestration** using Kubernetes  

> 💡 **Note:**This is only the web app that will be used for applying DevOps tools in a separate project.

## 💡 Purpose

This application is intentionally kept minimal to focus purely on DevOps tooling and workflows when integrated into a complete pipeline.  
It is ideal for use in DevOps portfolios, demonstrations, or practice environments.

## ▶️ Running the Server

To run the server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port **8080**.  
You can access the application in your browser at:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/home
```
